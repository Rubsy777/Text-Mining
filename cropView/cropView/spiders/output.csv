Since the crop leaves much of the ground uncovered, soil erosion and water losses can be severe. The optimum yield is 7-11 t/ha, world average 3.6 t/ha. High yields of maize make a heavy drain on soil nutrients and it has a high nitrogen requirement. The species is probably indigenous to Mexico and Central America. Some short-season varieties are able to develop with only 300 mm of rain."
2175,Zea mays,"DESCRIPTION: A tall vigorous annual grass, and grain crop varying greatly in size according to race and growth conditions; commercial types are about 2m tall. It has many fasciculate roots. The erect shoot (culm) consists of four basic structures: the internodes, the leaves, the prophyll and the bud or apical meristem, which are collectively called the phytomer. The leaves that emerge from its nodes are alternate, lanceolate, acuminate and parallel-veined with small ligules. Maize is a monoecious plant; it develops inflorescences with unisexual flowers, and these are always born in separate parts of the plant. The female inflorescence - the ear, arises from the axillary bud apices, and male inflorescence, the tassel, develops from the apical growing point at the top of the plant. The kernel or fruit of maize is called a caryopsis. The ovary wall or pericarp is fused with the seed coat or testa and these combined together make the fruit wall. The mature fruit consists of three major parts - fruit wall, diploid embryo and triploid endosperm. The outermost layer of the endosperm, in contact with fruit wall is called the aleurone layer. The mature corn kernel is made up of three main parts, the seed coat or pericarp, the starchy endosperm and the embryo often called the germ, which will develop into a new plant. USES: It is mainly grown for food and fodder. The grain is ground to flour and used in starchy foods and breads. It is used in breakfast foods. Fermented grain is made into alcohol, which has become a prime use in the USA. A ton of dried maize would yield about 370 kg of ethanol. Maize starch is used in cosmetics, adhesives, glucose and syrup. Oil is extracted from the embryo and used as salad oil, and to make linolium, paints, varnishes, etc. KILLING T.: It is easily killed by frost. GROWING PERIOD: Annual. In Kenya quick-maturing lowland varieties flower in 60 days and mature in 120 days, varieties grown between 1200-2100 m in elevation flowers in 105 days and mature in 210 days, while varieties grown at 2100-3200 m may take 195 days to flower and more than 365 days to mature. In the United States on average it mature in 90-140 days. FURTHER INF.: Maize is one of the most productive species of food plants being the second most important cereal grain after wheat, with milled rice occupying third place. It is the top ranking cereal in grain yield per hectare and is second to wheat in total production. Maize is of great economic significance worldwide as human food as animal feed, and as a source of large number of industrial products. Maize has tremendous variability in kernel colour, texture, composition and appearance. It is classified into distinct types based on (a) endosperm and kernel constitution; (b) kernel colour; (c) environment in which it is grown; d) maturity; and (e) its use. White, yellow and orange are prominent grain colours. Prominent maize kernel types are flint, dent, pop, sweet, floury, morocho, and waxy. Quality Protein Maize (QPM with improved protein quality), and High Oil Corn are speciality maize types. It can be found at elevations between sea level and 4000 m and it can be grown at latitudes from 48°N to 40°S. The photosynthesis pathway C4 III for tropical lowland types and C4 IV for highland and temperate types. Hot, dry winds may reduce the amount of pollen available for fertilization and humid conditions and hail can do damage. Since the crop leaves much of the ground uncovered, soil erosion and water losses can be severe. The optimum yield is 7-11 t/ha, world average 3.6 t/ha. High yields of maize make a heavy drain on soil nutrients. It is probably indigenous to Mexico and Central America."

2153,Vigna unguiculata,"DESCRIPTION: It is a herbaceous, prostrate, climbing, or sub-erect to erect legume, growing 15-80 cm high. Erect and bushy to prostrate and creeping growth habits exist depending on cultivar and growing conditions. Cowpeas develop strong root systems that have many spreading laterals in the surface soil. The stems have circular sections and are pock marked. They are sometimes slightly grooved and are glabrous. The texture is fibrous and hard, firm and not inflated when young. Leaves are alternate and trifoliolate and the leaflets are oval, pointed (6-15 cm x 4-11 cm). They are generally entire and sometimes lobed. Genotypes vary in the degree of pubescence, but all cultivated cowpeas are less glabrous than other legumes such as common bean and soybean. Stipules are spurred at the base, stipels are hardly visible. Inflorescence racemose, flowers white, cream, yellow, mauve or purple. Pods usually occur in pairs forming a V, and are non-dehiscent. Pod orientation is mostly pendant and vertical. Pod length ranges from 6.5-25 cm and the width ranges from 3-12 mm. Under warm conditions, pod development is rapid and may take only two weeks from pollination to pod maturation. Each pod holds from 8 to 20 seeds in a crowded orientation. Seed length is between 6-11 mm and the width is from 4-9 mm. The testa colour also varies from white, pinky-white, pink, tan, brown, and black. The hylum is often ringed black or brown, strongly contrasting with the shade of the testa and hence the name ""blackeyed beans"" of the Antilles. The testa is thick and of ellipsoid and more or less rounded form. Number of seeds per kg is from 4600 up to 16000. USES: Cowpea is one of the most important grain legumes in Africa and in parts of the Americas and Asia. In addition to its dry grain, fresh-shelled 'peas', fresh pods, and fresh and dried leaves and flowers are consumed in some regions. The plant is used as cut and carry forage, and for hay and silage. Cowpea forms highly effective associations with a wide range of native nitrogen fixing strains of Rhizobium bacteria and with mycorrhizae that allows the species to tolerate poor soils. Used as a green manure, it can be incorporated into the soil 8-10 weeks after sowing, and can provide the equivalent of 80 kg/ha N to a subsequent crop. KILLING T.: It is susceptible to frost. GROWING PERIOD: Annual. Some cowpea accessions may start flowering 30 days after sowing and are ready for harvest of dry seeds 25 days later; others may take more than 90 days to flower, and 210-240 days to mature. COMMON NAMES: Cowpea, crowder pea, clack-eyed pea, couthern pea, atimbawini, boeme, boontjie, catjang, caupí, frijol de vaca, imbumba, isihlumaya. FURTHER INF.: It is native of West Africa and cultivated throughout the tropics and subtropics between 40ºN and 30ºS at elevations between sea level and 2000 m. Occurs in areas with annual rainfall between 400-2000 mm and summer temperatures between 25-35°C. Found on a wide range of very acid (pH 4) to strongly alkaline also low-fertility soils from sands to heavy, well-drained clays, with a preference for lighter soils. It does not tolerate extended flooding or salinity. Most cowpea accessions exhibit classic short-day responses with respect to time of flowering, although a range of sensitivities occur and the effect is modulated by temperature. It is mainly autogamous and in most environments outcrossing is low (less than 5%), but in the presence of bumble bees or other large insects, out-crossing can be much higher. Flowers open early in the morning, close by noon and may fall off during the same day. The photoperiodism of many African landraces confers adaptation to a specific latitude and rainfall pattern such that flowering and pod development coincide with the end of the rainy season in a particular place ensuring that pods mature in dry weather thus avoiding pod rots and other diseases. The photosynthetic pathway is C3 and the leaves have full maximal rates of photosynthesis at full expansion. Vegetative DM production 3-10 t/ha in 8-12 weeks; grain production 250-4000 kg/ha."

2074,Theobroma cacao,"DESCRIPTION: A small semi-deciduous cauliflorous tree 5-10 m high with a foliage canopy of 4-5 m in diameter when about 10 years old. When fully developed the taproot is 0.8-2 m deep. Lateral roots arise along its entire length but only develop to any great extent in the upper portion, usually from the collar to 15-20 cm down. Up to 10 branched lateral roots may develop in the topsoil covering a 5-6 m radius and with a mass of root hairs. The main trunk is short; branches in whorls of 5, dimorphic; vertical chupons growing from the trunk have leaves arranged in 5/8 phyllotaxy. The lateral branches (fans) have 1/2 phyllotaxy. Stems initially develop orthotropically then in successive elongation phases up to 18 months with a 1-1.5 m trunk. Further growth is interrupted by the degeneration of the terminal bud, below which the first 3-5 branch meristems develop simultaneously, in the form of a whorl growing horizontally. These fan branches form the framework of the tree and are refereed to as a 'jorquette'. The young leaves, which appear either as the trunk develops or during the flushes, are very often pigmented. They appear in accordance with a 3/8 phyllotaxy arrangement. Their colour may vary, depending on the tree type, from pale green, to pink, to deep purple. The young leaves are limp and pendant; as they mature, they become dark green and rigid. The leaves are coriaceous or chartaceous, alternate, and distichous on normal branches. The petiole has 2 joined pulvini, one at the base and the other at the point of insertion of the leaf. Stipules 2, deciduous. Lamina elliptical-oblong or obovate-oblong, simple, 10-45 cm long; generally smooth, sometimes hairy, rounded and obtuse at the base, pointed apex. The inflorescence is dichasial; primary peduncle very short, often thick and lignified. Flower peduncle 1-4 cm long. Sepals 5, triangular, whitish or reddish in colour. Petals 5, joined at the base into a cuplike structure, whitish-yellow with dark purple bands adaxially; ligules spathulate, yellowish. Stamens 5, fertile, alternating with 5 staminodes, the 2 whorls uniting to form a tube. Anthers 2, stamens fused. Ovary superior with a single style terminating in 5 sticky stigmatic surfaces. The fruit is 10-15 cm long and yellow or purplish and is variable in shape, ovoid, oblong; sometimes pointed and constricted at the base or almost spherical, with 10 furrows of which 5 are prominent. Axial placentation, the seeds (embedded in mucilage) flat or round with white or purple cotyledons. The fruit is attached to the branch or trunk by a woody stalk which was originally the stalk of the flower but which thickens as the pod develops. The pericarp or cortex of the pod consists of three distinct layers; the hairy and thick epicarp, which is more or less hard (the epidermis of which may be pigmented); the mesocarp, which is thin and hard and more or less woody; and the hairy endocarp, which is of varying thickness. Pods generally contain an average of thirty to forty seeds, an estimate which is convenient for a rough evaluation of yield in the plantation. However, the number of seeds per pod varies enormously. The cocoa seed or fresh bean is shaped rather like a plump almond, and is surrounded by a white mucilaginous pulp; which is both sweet and rather sour. The average dimensions of the seed are 20-30 mm in length, 12-16 wide and 7-12 thick. Cocoa seeds readily germinate when sown and do not pass through a dormancy period. They lose viability within 5-7 days of extraction from the pod unless specially treated, and germinate within 7-10 days. The plant can easily be propagated vegetatively by leaf-bud cutting, multiple-bud cutting, marcotting, budding, grafting and layering. USES: Food: The cocoa bean, with up to 50% fat, is a valuable source of vegetable fat: cocoa butter. The residual cocoa powder is used in cakes, biscuits, chocolate, drinking chocolate and other confectioneries. Fodder: The cocoa-pod husk has a low alkaloid content, while tannin is practically absent and husks are used as stock feed. The crude fibre content is low; it is completely unlignified and compares favourably with "

1982,Sorghum bicolor var. sweet,"DESCRIPTION: A single-stemmed grass and cereal crop reaching a height of 1-5 m; it is usually taller than grain sorghum. It has a strong root system and a layer of heavy disilicate covers the epidermis of the root. As the root grows to maturity it forms an entire silicon column; which provides it with enough mechanical density during a drought period to prevent the root system from collapsing. It has fibrous, spreading roots and consists of a primary, secondary and supporting roots. The primary root is developed from the seed embryo. It is the only embryo root produced by the seed during germination. Before the production of secondary roots, the primary root is the main organ by which the plant absorbs nutrients and moisture from the soil. Prop roots may grow from culm nodes. There is a bud at each node from which a tiller may grow. The only temporary root in sorghum is the single radicle of the germinating seedling. Mature roots of sorghum are all adventitious. Those permanent roots have numerous branched lateral roots interlacing the soil in all directions. The system may extend to at least 1.5 m away from the plant, and is most abundant in the top 90 cm, although it may extend to twice that depth. One of the important factors affecting water use and drought endurance must be the effectiveness of the root system. While the primary roots of maize and sorghum are equally extensive, sorghum possesses twice as many secondary roots as maize at any one stage of growth. After the plant produces 3-4 leaves, secondary roots grow out from the base of the stalk node near the soil surface. The stalk has about 10-20 clearly protruding nodes and a leaf is produced from every node. Leaves (30-135 cm long and 6-13 cm wide) are opposite-decussate and consist of the sheath, blade and tongue or ligule. The sheath is very long and adheres closely to a major part of the internode. The blade is broad, strap-like, dentate and the surface is smooth and covered with a waxy powder which plays a role in reducing evaporation. In dry conditions, the leaf blade will roll up into a tube, reducing the exposed area and thus cutting down the loss of moisture. Flowers are grouped in an apical panicle formed by several reddish spikelets. The grain is an oblong caryopsis; which consists of the seed coat, testa, endosperm and embryo. The shapes and colours of seeds are very varied and are covered by glumes and there are round, flat-round, oval, ellipse shapes etc. The colours include white, light yellow, pink, brown, red-brown, dark brown etc. In general, the seed of sweet sorghum is smaller than that of grain sorghum; the thousand-seed weight is about 21g varying between 16-28g. (25,000 to 61,740/kg for sweet and grain sorghum; 120,000 to 159,000/kg for grass sorghum). USES: The versatility of sweet sorghum resulted in Prof. Li Dajue (of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and Peter Griffee (FAO) coining the name the ""Four F's Crop"" for sweet sorghum in 1997 at the first International Sweet Sorghum Conference. The ""Four Fs"" represent the four potential outputs from sweet sorghum, namely: Food, Fuel, Fodder, & Fibre. In Asia, R&D has concentrated on maximizing all four outputs to produce the 'multi-purpose' varieties, whilst in Europe, the potential use of sweet sorghum as a sugar producer for fuel ethanol production has driven the current direction of R&D towards liquid bio-fuel production. In southern Africa, the potential for using sweet sorghum for energy and crystalline sugar production is being explored. A disadvantage is that the stems have to be processed within a matter of hours after harvest. However, new technology is emerging for in-field juice extraction and storage to extend the factory processing period. The grain can be ground into flour, some cultivars can be used as popcorn and the grain can be manufactured into beer. Stems are used for thatching, fencing, brushes, and basketry. A dye can be extracted. Grain and straw can be fed to livestock and embryos yield an oil used in cooking and salad oils. The inflorescence has astringent, haemostatic and antidiarrhoeic properties and administration is as infusion, tincture and medicinal wine. GROWING PERIOD: Annual or short-term perennial grass. Most sorghum plants take 90-120 days to mature, the boot stage is reached in 50-60 days, flowering in 60-70 days and full grain maturity in 90-120 days. COMMON NAMES: Sorghum, Sorgho, Sorgo, Great millet, Milo, Jowar, Cholam, Guinea corn, Durra, Mtama, Jowal, Jolar, Cholam, Koaliang. FURTHER INF.: Lowland tropical sorghums are adapted to warm days and night temperatures above 22°C throughout the growing season. The poisonous glucocide 'dhurrin' in sorghum is present from germination, increasing to a maximum and then disappearing as the grain develops, so that in the later stages the plants is safe as fodder. New long day varieties exist. The photosynthesis pathway C4III. The species is probably indigenous to North-East Africa, north of latitude 10°N and east of longitude 25°E. Sorghum is grown between 40°N and S. Sweet sorghum can be found at elevations between sea level and 1500 m, most East African sorghum is grown between the altitudes of 900-1500 m, and cool-tolerant varieties are grown between 1600 and 2500 m. The nutrient removal for 1 ton of grain is about 50 kg N, 9 kg P, and 45 kg K, calculated from the above-ground plant mass. Grain yields of up to 4 t/ha can be obtained, but in the driest areas, the yield usually varies between 0.3-1.2 t/ha, and the global average is about 1.3 t/ha. Like the common grain sorghum, sweet sorghum can produce grain yields of 1500-7500 kg/ha. But the essence of sweet sorghum is not from its seed, but from its stalk; which contains sugar. In general, the stalk yield is 45000-75000 kg/ha. The sugar content in the juice of sweet sorghum varies in different varieties. It's Brix ranges generally from between 15-23%."
48747,Sorghum bicolor,"DESCRIPTION: Summer annual, coarse, erect with much variability in growth characteristics; culms solid or sometimes with spaces in pith, 0.6ˆ5 m tall, depending on variety and growing conditions, 5 to over 30 mm in diameter, either dry at maturity or with sweet insipid juice; leaves broad and coarse, similar in shape to those of corn but shorter and wider; blades glabrous and waxy; sheaths encircle culm and have overlapping margins; panicle erect, sometimes recurved, usually compact in most grain sorghums and more open in forage types; seed covered by glumes that may or may not be removed by threshing; prop roots may grow from culm nodes; bud at each node from which a tiller may grow; seeds white, yellow, red, or brown; panicle with up to 6,000 spikelets. Seeds 25,000 to 61,740/kg. USES: Grown for grain, forage, syrup and sugar, and industrial uses of stems and fibers.

Important summer fodder where temperatures are high and rainfall insufficient for corn. Most important for silage or green soiling, or for hay when grown irrigated in very dry areas. FURTHER INF.: Ranging from Cool Temperate Steppe to Wet through Tropical Thorn to Wet Forest Life Zones, sorghum is reported to tolerate annual precipitation of 2.0 to 41.0 (mean of 86 cases = 10.9), annual temperature of 7.8 to 27.8°C (mean of 86 cases = 20.1), and pH of 4.3 to 8.7 (mean of 69 cases = 6.7). Adapted to tropical and subtropical summer rainfall climate with rainfall from 25ˆ125 cm annually; of little importance in more humid areas with higher rainfall. Some cvs are short-day plants. Adapted to wide range of soils varying from light loams to heavy clays; thrives best on light, easily worked soils of high fertility, with moderate to high available water, with erosion not a problem. Moderately well-drained soils are suitable for sorghums. Small amounts of alkali in sand reduces performance considerably. Tolerance to salinity is moderate. Prefers moderately acid soil; pH down to 5.7 does not drastically affect production."

Flowers white or blue, pedunculate in lateral, many flowered cymes, the hairy peduncle 5-15 cm long, the jointed hairy pedicels 3-35 mm long. Calyx campanulate, 5-lobate, 1.5-2 cm in diameter, the lobes acute or acuminate. Corolla twice as long as calyx, 3.5-4 cm in diameter. Anthers free, erect, poricidal, yellow. Fruit a globose 2-celled berry, many-seeded, yellowish green. The tubers are mostly located within the top 25 cm of the soil. USES: It is cultivated for its edible tubers. Tubers are one of the temperate staples, eaten boiled, baked, fried, stewed, candied with syrup, or pureed and they are processed into fried chips, starch, flour, glucose, and alcohol and they can be canned or dehydrated etc. Surplus potatoes are used for fodder and alcohol, and chemurgic applications. The flour can be used for baking. Potato starch is used to determine the diastatic value of starch. Boiled with weak sulphuric acid, potato starch is changed into glucose and fermented into alcohol. It is estimated that potatoes would give 104 liters ethanol per ton of production. Rotten potatoes and the waste in the potato chip industry can be converted to butanol with a greater energy content than ethanol. Twenty percent butanol can be added to regular gas and up to 40% to diesel as extenders without engine modification. Ripe potato juice is excellent for cleaning cottons, silks, and woolens. Root and leaf diffusates of growing potato plants possess cardiotonic activity. Dried ethanol extracts of above-ground parts show marked hypotensive and myotropic action and a spasmolytic and soothing effect on intestinal musculature. Ethanol extracts of leaves have antifungal properties, active against Phytophthora infestans. Leaves, seeds, and tuber extracts show antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The tubers contain 8-28% starch and 1-4% protein. KILLING T.: -1"

FURTHER INF  Robustum sugar cane is native of New Guinea, where it is commonly found along riverbanks forming dense stands. Photosynthesis pathway C4."
1884,Saccharum officinarum,"DESCRIPTION: The sugar cane plant is a large perennial tropical grass with thick stems that may grow up to 2-3 meters tall, but with extended growing periods it can become much taller. The roots of the cane plant develop from the growth ring on the original planting piece and also from the new shoots that develop. The majority of the roots are thin and superficial with four fifths of the roots commonly found in the top 25-50 cm. Thicker roots will penetrate to depths of four meters or more. The stem of sugarcane is economically the most important plant part. The stems are made up of nodal units, which include the node and the internode. The internal part of the stem is largely parenchyma interspersed with vascular bundles. The parenchyma cells accumulate sugar. Each node subtends a leaf with an axillary bud at the base of the leaf sheath. The individual shoots of sugarcane show strong apical dominance; however, when this is broken the axillary buds develop into new shoots. Contrary to most grasses, the stem is not hollow but filled, as in maize and sorghum. In a magnified cross section it presents the typical aspect of a monocotyledon. Inside the rind tissue and within the vascular bundle is the delicate parenchyma that contains the sucrose-rich plasma. The leaves of sugarcane are distributed alternately on the stem and comprise the leaf sheath and the leaf blade or lamina. The leaf sheath wraps closely round the stem and in some varieties clings to the stem long after the leaf blade and the sheath have senesced. On some varieties the sheath ruptures naturally where it joins the node and the leaves fall naturally. Leaves and sheaths of some varieties are covered with a large number of siliceous hairs. These hairs penetrate the skin of cane cutters and are most unpleasant; hence cane cutters prefer varieties with few hairs or burnt cane. The terminal meristem of the cane shoot turns reproductive about 3 months before the emergence of the flower. The flowers of cane are of no commercial significance per se, and many varietal selection programs are directed towards the elimination of flowering in commercial fields. Flowering is, however, of great importance in breeding programs, many of which use artificial methods to stimulate flowering. USES: It provides raw sugar. Important by-products are bagasse, molasses, filter mud cakes, and cane wax. Bagasse is residue used as fuel, livestock feed, and for the manufacture of fiberboard, paper pulp, plastic, furfural, and cellulose. Molasses are fed to livestock, used for industrial purposes, in confectionary, and it is the source of industrial alcohol as well as rum and gin. Filter mud cakes are used as fertilizer. Cane wax is used in the production of furniture, shoe, and leather polishes, electrical insulating material, and waxed paper. Brazil is a major grower of sugarcane, which is used to produce sugar and provide the ethanol used in making gasoline-ethanol blends (gasohol) for transportation fuel. KILLING T.: Seedlings may not tolerate -7 to -12°C, and the mature plant not -2°C. Long-term exposure to temperatures below 10°C may also be lethal. When temperatures reach 0°C leaves become chlorotic, at about -3°C young plants turn brown and the terminal buds and leaves of mature cane die, at -5.5°C the millable stem dies. When the temperature reaches -11.5°C the whole plant dies in susceptible clones. There are large varietal differences in cold tolerance and susceptibility to frost. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, growing from 7-24 months, usually 14-18 months, with an additional 12 months for the ratoon crop. It is normally grown as a perennial crop in which several ratoons are taken. COMMON NAMES: Sugarcane, Nobel cane, Canne a sucre, Cana de azucar, Zuckerrohr. FURTHER INF.: For ripening relative low temperatures in the range of 10-20°C and dry weather are desirable. Sugarcane is photoperiod sensitive. Flowering is induced by a continuous reduction in day length of as little as 1 minute per day from long days of about 13 hours. Most commercial sugarcane is grown between 35°N and S in the tropics usually at altitudes from sea level to 1600 m. Nobel canes are native to islands in the South Pacific, most probably New Guinea. The photosynthesis pathway C4 III. Cane us is considered to be moderately tolerant to saline soil conditions; electrical conductivity of the soil solution should be less than 2 d S m-1 with a threshold value of 4 d S m-1. In Khuzestan, Iran, cane is grown on soils which have been desalinated from an EC of 30 to 3 dS/m-1. Cane is relatively tolerant of acid soils with large areas of cane in Latin America grown on the acid oxisols and utisols. It prefers moderate to high humidity and high winds cause damage and lower yields. Where sugarcane is grown under irrigation in Africa, a yield of 100-150 tons of cane/ha is obtained from the plant crop and 60-90 tons from the first ratoon crop. Under rain-fed conditions, about half of the above mentioned yield is obtained. Sugarcane is grown on over 20 million ha with an average yield of 64 t/ha to produce a total of 1,25 million t of cane. This is equivalent to about 130 million t of sugar if all the cane were used to produce sugar in moderately efficient factories. Centrifuged sugar production from cane is much less, as large quantities of cane are used to produce alcohol, particularly in Brazil as a liquid fuel."

1866,Ricinus communis,"DESCRIPTION: Castor in tropical countries is an erect herbaceous shrub or a small plant 6-10 m tall; its longevity is 8-12 years. In moderate climates this plant has a woody stem 0.5-4 m tall and it dies during autumn due to frosts or as a result of desiccation. The taproot penetrates the soil up to 1.5-3 m, or in the case of a crop of many years standing, up to 5-6 m. Most important are the secondary lateral roots that spread in the ploughed layer up to 1 m. If there is insufficient moisture the root grows deep, with little lateral spreading, whereupon their development leads to growth of the above ground mass. The stems are succulent, herbaceous, very variable in all aspects - 7.5-15 cm in diameter. Its stem is geniculate, thick, branching and terminates with a raceme spike. In some of the varieties grown in Russia, the stem has from 5 to 12 nodes and the same number of leaves at a 30-100 cm height of stem, and the length of the internode is 6-10 cm. The dwarf varieties have short (1.5-3 cm) internodes. The castor plant is well foliated. Leaves are glabrous and alternate on the basis of a 2/5 layout, except the first two opposite leaves. They are 10-16 cm wide, smooth, rarely wrinkled and have stipules at the base of their long (20-50 cm) glandular petioles.

The pilose surface of the leaves may be green or purple on both sides, or purple on the underside only. Each leaf has seven to eight pairs of lateral veins, which are closer together near the base. The veins on the upper surface are slightly raised, significantly so on the underside. The petiole is flat and villose. Composed of a pair of flowers, the villose corymb inflorescence may grow terminally or from the leaf axil. The ten-veined, campanulate calyx is villous basally outside and yellow glandular dotted on the surface, and pilose near the inside base, arranged in a ring. The calyx is initially about 3 mm long, but expands to 1.1 cm, spreading or drooping and swollen at the base when fruited. The labiate calyx has a broad upper sepal that is three-lobed and slightly longer than the lower sepal, which has two lanceolate lobes. The corolla is campanulate, white to magenta, 3-4 mm long, glabrous, and slightly pilose outside but less so inside. The limb of the corolla is also labiate, and composed of a slightly lobed upper petal and three-lobed lower petal. The sub-globose fruits are reticulate nutlets, grayish brown, about 1.5 mm in diameter. In China, flowers and fruits appear in August and linger until November to December. USES: It is widely cultivated as a source of medicine and spices. Perilla oil, a drying oil, which is contained in the seed, is edible (a cooking oil) and also used as a preservative and energy source. It is used in making paints, varnishes, water proofing etc. The seeds of perilla contain 31 to 51% of this drying oil, which is similar to tung or linseed oil. The plant yields 0.3-1.3% essential oil, which contains 20% citral. It is also used in dental products. One of the aldehyde isomers found in Perilla is 2,000 times as sweet as sugar. HABITAT: It is found wild in pastures and fields, dry woods, along roadsides, about home-sites, and in waste places. ENVIRONMENT: It needs warm weather and can grow in full sun as well as light (not dark) shade. However, the seed needs light to sprout. It thrives in well drained as well as wet soils. It grows well on fertile sites. It is hardy to zone 8 and is frost tender. It prefers light (sandy) and medium (loamy) acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. COMMON NAMES: It is widely known as the beefsteak plant. In North America, it is increasingly commonly called by its Japanese name, shiso in addition to being generally referred to as perilla. FURTHER INF.: The economic return from production of perilla as an oilseed in the United States is unprofitable in comparison with linseed.

Fruit is a caryopsis with an adherent pericarp. USES: It is a cultivated range and fodder grass and is grazed by certain animals, used as ground cover to control erosion and farmed as forage for livestock. As a drought resistant ornamental grass, it is easily grown in average to wet soils and in full sun to part shade. Establishment is recommended in the spring, at the same time as maize is planted. It can also be used for silage and as an energy substitute and is often considered a good candidate for bio-fuel, especially ethanol fuel production, due to its hardiness against poor soil and climate conditions, rapid growth and low fertilization and herbicide requirements. It has the potential to produce the biomass required for production of up to 380 liters of ethanol per metric ton. This gives it the potential to produce over 400 liters of ethanol per hectare, compared to 270 for sugarcane and 160 for corn. However, there is debate on the viability of switchgrass, and other bio-fuels, as an efficient energy source. University of California, Berkeley professor Tad Patzek argues that switchgrass has a negative ethanol fuel energy balance, requiring 45 percent more fossil energy than the fuel produced. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial; warm season; sod forming; slow spreader. FURTHER INF.: Switchgrass uses C4 carbon fixation, giving it an advantage in conditions of drought and high temperature. As an open pollinated species, switchgrass expresses tremendous genetic diversity, with wide variations in its basic chromosome number (2n = 18), typically ranging from tetraploid to octoploid. Morphologically switchgrass in its southern range can grow to more than 3 m in height, but what is most distinctive is the deep, vigorous root system, which may extend to depths of more than 3.5 m. It reproduces both by seeds and vegetatively and, with its perennial life form, a stand can last indefinitely once established. Standing biomass in root systems may exceed that found aboveground, giving perennial grasses such as switchgrass, an advantage in water and nutrient aquisition even under stressful growing conditions.

75061,Orbignya phalerata,"DESCRIPTION: It is an erect, sometimes solitary palm reaching 20-30 m in height. Full grown palms have an almost bare stem, slightly conical with a diameter of 20-50 cm. Surface grey to brown, smooth and obscurely ringed with leaf scars, adventitious roots sometimes visible at the base of the stem. The stem carries a dense crown, of arching pinnate leaves, with a diameter of about 8 m. It consists of 15-20 leaves, each reaching 5-8 m in length. The top leaves are typically pointing upward. The inflorescence is cream-white turning yellow and finally brownish at anthesis. Flowers unisexual. Staminate flowers yellowish, slightly fragrant, asymmetrical with 3 sepals and 2-3 petals. Pistillate flowers cream-yellow with 3-6 sepals and 3-5 petals. It produces fruit in large bunches containing, on average, 200 individual fruits and attaining a length of one meter or more. However, bunches with up to 600 fruits do occur. Bunches may have very long stalks. The individual bunch weights range from 40-90 kg and the tree produces 1-4 bunches each year. Production starts when it is around 8 years old. The individual fruits are 8-15 cm long and 5-9 cm broad and weigh 150-200 g. Palms growing wild produce only 20 kg/ha compared to 1500 kg/ha in experimental plantations. This is largely due to the greater tree density. Each fruit contains 3-8 kernels. USES: The kernel yields 60-70% of oil, which is somewhat similar to coconut oil. It is colourless and does not readily become rancid. Refined oil can be used for margarine production and general food purposes. The crude oil is suitable for soap production and detergents. It is also used for burning in lamps. In addition to its importance for the extraction of edible oil the Babassu palm can be used to make many products during its life cycle. The leaves are used for thatch, basketwork, construction and fodder, the trunks for bridges and building and the fruit for animal feed and charcoal. The palm is of considerable economic importance in rural Brazil and it is estimated that some 450 000 families collect and process Babassu. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Babassu, babaçu, aguassu, coco de macaco. FURTHER INF.: It requires a tropical humid climate and high temperatures with plenty of sunshine. It is mainly found on moderately drained alluvial sandy soils that are not exposed to water logging or flooding. It requires fertile soil. It may become a weed. The apical meristem remains below ground for several years after the leaves have emerged. This makes it an aggressive competitor in some circumstances and control is therefore difficult."

The bark is pale grey and the flowers numerous, small and creamy white in colour and are largely hidden by the evergreen leaves and grow on a long stem arising from the leaf axils. The olive produces two kinds of flowers: a perfect flower containing both male and female parts, and a staminate flower with stamens only. The flowers are largely wind pollinated with most olive varieties being self-pollinating, although fruit set is usually improved by cross-pollination with other varieties. There are self-incompatible varieties that do not set fruit without other varieties nearby, and there are varieties that are incompatible with certain others. Incompatibility can also occur for environmental reasons such as high temperatures. The dark purple fruit is a drupe about 2 cm long, ovoid and often pointed, the fleshy part filled with oil. The pulp is bitter, due to tannin in the raw fruit, and contains up to 20% oil. The thick, bony stone has a blunt keel down one side. It contains a single seed. The seeds of a few varieties are green when ripe and some turn a shade of copper brown. The cultivars vary considerably in size, shape, oil-content and flavor.

It is grown at the damp water-inlet areas in reservoirs and removes debris from floodwater entering the reservoir. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Black mimosa, giant sensitive plant, mimosa, pricky wood weed. FURTHER INF: It is a legume of moist, open sites in the tropics, in Australia, forming monospecific stands and competing with sedgeland and grassland communities so that the ground flora under dense stands is sparse to non-existent. Its favoured habitat is around water and on floodplains. Since the late 1970s, the plant has become a serious weed of pastureland and national parks in northern Australia. It grows quickly, it can withstand drought and floods, and the seeds float. It threatens biological diversity by replacing wetlands with an impenetrable thorny thicket. However, it presents a very different picture in its native range, where its natural habitat is mainly marginal areas of canals, rivers and lakes, and this gives some hope to researchers looking for biological controls."

1420,Manihot esculenta,"DESCRIPTION: An erect shrub with an upright woody stems reaching a height of 4 m or more. The mature tuber may measure 1 m in length and weigh up to 2 kg. The cassava plant may be divided into two main parts: the shoot system, which consists of stem, leaves and reproductive structures or flowers; and the root system, which consists of feeder roots and tubers. The fleshy elongated tuberous roots or rhizomes, are very woody, only slightly thickened in wild varieties; under cultivation up to 2.5 m long and 10-15 cm in diameter, weighing up to 40 kg, averaging 4-7 kg; leaves usually deeply 3-7-parted with spatulate to linear-lanceolate acuminate lobes 7.5-15 cm long, glabrous, glaucous beneath and minutely puberulent along veins, long petioled; flowers in panicles, less than 1.2 cm long; capsules globose, about 1.2 cm across, with 6 winged angles; seeds 3 per capsule. USES: Cassava provides a major source of calories for poor families, because of its high starch content. With minimum maintenance, the farmers can dig up the starchy root of the cassava and eat it 6 months to 3 years after planting. Thus, people can cultivate cassava during times of conflict or natural disaster when no other food is available. The tubers have a high content of carbohydrates, phosphorous, iron, and calcium and are a valuable source of food. Cassava starch is used in cooking and cassava flour is used in puddings, biscuits and other confectionary. In Africa, people also eat the leaves of the cassava as a green vegetable, which provide a cheap and rich source of protein and vitamins A and B. (Young leaves are cooked like spinach). Various industries use it as a binding agent, because it is an inexpensive source of starch. Cassava starch is used in the production of paper and textiles and as monosodium glutamate (MSG), an important flavoring agent in Asian cooking. In Africa, cassava is beginning to be used in partial substitution for wheat flour, thus providing income to resource-poor farmers and saving foreign exchange for national Governments. The plant is also used in the production of adhesives, cosmetics, textiles, and paper. It is fed to livestock. Alcoholic beverages and ethanol for fuel are made from the tubers. The advantage of cassava for ethanol production is that the tubers may be stored in the ground for many months before processing; thus extending the factory window. KILLING T.: May not tolerate 7°C for prolonged periods and it is easily killed by frost. GROWING PERIOD: Short-lived perennial. Mature leaves may be harvested 50-70 days from insertion of the cuttings. The 'sweet' cassavas mature in 180-270 days, the 'bitter' in 12-18 months. Growing period 6-24 months, depending on cultivar and conditions. COMMON NAMES: Cassava, Manihot, Manioc, Tapioca, Guacomote Yuca, Cassave, Kelala, Marachini, Maravalli, Simul Alu, Ubi Singkong, Mangahazo, Ubi Kayu, Mun Sumpalung, Boodin, Kaspe, Katela, Bodin, Obi Kajoe, Poohoong Kahoy, Kamoteng, Tentu Neskok, Muk Shue, Pok Fung, Cassada, Aipi, Aipim Ubi, Ketalla, Macaxiera, Mandioca, Manoco, Ramu, Yautia. FUTHER INF.: Cassava is seldom grown above 1800 m in elevation in the tropics, maximum elevation for successfull cultivation is about 1000 m. Latitudinal range is 25°N to 30°S. Maximum tolerated slope is about 5°. The photosynthesis pathway is C3 II. Prefers moderate humidity. Tuber production is delayed and reduced in daylengths greater than 10-12 hours. Cassava is native to the countries between the Amazon region and southern Mexico. World production for 2004 was estimated at 204819995 metric tons. Production in Asia during the same period was 60492789 metric tons and in Africa 108974574. Area harvested in 2004: World 18051574 hectares Brazil 1754875 Congo 1842559 Indonesia 1255805 Nigeria 3531000 and Mozambique 1068500 hectares. Yields from small holders average 5-15 t/ha, but yields of up to 30 t/ha can be obtained. Scientists at two CGIAR research centers IITA and CIAT have developed elite varieties of cassava with improved qualities. IITA has discovered spontaneous polyploids in cassava, which are characterized by enormous vigor and variation in form and structure. Selections from triploids ""super cassava"" have doubled the yields of existing improved varieties with normal chromosome numbers. IITA has also introduced to Africa a wider genetic base for cassava improvement, focusing on materials with resistance to mites, mealybugs, cassava bacterial blight, tolerance to drought, low cyanogen potential, and good cooking quality. Together, IITA and CIAT launched a biological control campaign of the mealybug and are cooperating with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in the formulation of a global development strategy for cassava."

It can for non-commercial production be grown at elevations up to 1200 m and up to 600 m for commercial production. It does best with strongly marked seasons in the tropical summer rainfall regions with dry weather and moderate humidity for flowering and fruiting. High humidity, mist and heavy dew promote fungal attack, while low humidity and drying wind can cause wilting and strong winds may destroy the crop. In areas with two wet seasons flowering and fruit production may occur twice each year, but normally only one crop per year is produced. Very fertile soils with adequate supplies of water thoughout the year may result in luxuriant vegetative growth and poor cropping. The trees are drought-tolerant and do not seem to suffer from occasional flooding. According to Purseglove even shallow and impervious soils produce mangoes, but for optimal conditions the watertable should be below 2-2.5 m. Photosynthesis pathway C 3 II. In the 10th year, a tree bears 400-600 fruits. A plantation of full-grown trees may produce 10-30 t/ha of fruit year.

Inflorescence a cyme formed terminally on branches and complex, possessing main and co-florescences with paracladia. The plant is monoecious and flowers are unisexual; occasionally hermaphroditic flowers occur; 10 stamens arranged in 2 distinct whorls of 5 each in a single column in the androecium and in close proximity to each other. In the gynaecium, the 3 slender styles are connate to about 2/3 of their length, dilating to a massive bifurcate stigma. Female flowers with sepals up to 18 mm long, persistent; ovary 3-locular, ellipsoid, 1.5-2 mm in diameter, style bifid. Fruit an ellipsoid capsule 2.5-3 cm long, 2-3 cm in diameter, yellow, turning black. Seeds black, 2 per cell, ellipsoid, triangular-convex, 1.5-2 x 1-1.1 cm. Pollination is by insects. The rare hermaphroditic flowers can be self-pollinating. After pollination the trilocular ellipsoid fruit is formed. The exocarp remains fleshy until the seeds are mature. In Thailand, there are 2 flowering peaks, in November and May. In permanently humid equatorial regions, flowering occurs throughout the year. Fruit development needs 90 days from flowering until seeds mature. Shrubs begin to produce at 4-5 months and reach full productivity at about 3 years. The female flowers are 4-5 times more numerous than the male ones. USES: Young leaves may be safely eaten when steamed or stewed. Cooked nuts are eaten in certain regions of Mexico. The seeds yield up to 31-37% of a valuable oil. The seed oil is renewable source of non-conventional bio-diesel. Fruit hulls and seed shells can be used as a fuel. Curcas oil contains a toxin, curcasin. The seed oil as well as seeds, leaves and bark have medicinal properties. It is grown for erosion control, as living fence and as a support for vanilla and other climbers. All plant parts can be used as a green manure. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Barbados nut, castor oil, Chinese castor oil, curcas, fig nut, physic nut, pig nut, purging nut, wild oil nut (English). FURTHER INF.: It is best adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions. It occurs in grassland-savannah and thorn forest scrub but is completely lacking from the moist Amazon region. The current distribution shows that introduction has been most successful in drier regions of the tropics. It is very tolerant and thrives under a wide range of edapho-climatic conditions. It is particularly hardy at medium altitude and in humid zones. It is not sensitive to day length. Its strength as a crop comes from its ability to grow on poor, dry sites. However, like any species that being adapted as a crop the yields are correlated with inputs. It is very drought tolerant and can withstand slight frost. It has been widely reported as resistant to pests and diseases; however due to increasing use as a monoculture for bio-diesel this is proving not to be the case.

1232,Hordeum vulgare,"DESCRIPTION: A freely tillering cultivated grass and cereal crop reaching a height of 50-100 cm. As with wheat and oats, barley also presents two types of root systems. In the first, the seedling roots develop from germination to the tillering stage; in the second, which starts at tillering, the secondary crown roots, or adventitious roots, appear. These will serve to anchor the plant, and to provide it with water and nutrients. The depth they reach will depend on the hydric condition of the soil, its texture and structure, external and internal temperatures, and on the genetic make up of the variety. The stems of the barley plant are erect and made up of 5 to 7 hollow, cylindrical internodes or joints, separated by the nodes, which bear the leaves. As in all Gramineae, the leaves are placed opposite their neighbours along the stem. The leaves are linear lanceolate and formed of sheath, blade, auricles and ligule. The sheaths surround the stem completely. The ligule, and especially the auricles, distinguish barley from other cereal grains: they are glabrous, envelop the stem and can be pigment with anthocyanins. Flowers-spikes: the last internode of the stem extends as a rachis, which bears the spicules alternating on its nodes. Spikes of distich barleys do not have a terminal spicule as do those of wheat. Spikes can be awned, mutic (blunt) or hooded, and also can be smooth or toothed. The spikes can have two or six rows of grain, depending on the fertility of the lateral spikes. The rachis has 10 to 30 nodes, so the ears of six-row barleys can have from 25 up to 60 grains, and two-row barleys 25 to 30. The fruit is an oval, ridged caryopsis with rounded ends. The spike may be long or short, according to the plant type, but it always has several glumes with filiform awns that may diverge. Seeds are generally covered, with the palea and the lemma adhered to them, or can be open. Grains can be white in colour, blue, black, etc. Barley is predominantly autogamous. USES: In the traditional areas, most barley is use for animal feed (half of the world's barley production). In the non-traditional areas, barley's principal use is as food, followed by animal feed and use as raw material for the malting industry. Pearl barley (used in soups, or fed to live stock) is the decorticated caryopsis, while barley that is allowed to germinate and is then dehydrated is called malt. A very nourishing drink made from the latter can be used as a substitute for coffee. Barley is also used commercially in the making of beer and whiskey. The cereal is prepared for eating by boiling or parching the whole grain. It can then be ground for gruel or made into flour for baking. Barley can also be grown as a hay crop. The caryopsis is used to prepare decoctions and fluid extract. It has nutritive, emollient and anticatarrhal properties. KILLING T.: The main climatic mishap is frost damage to the seedlings, when the death of many plants can drastically thin out the crop. At the seedling stage, barley is more susceptible to freezing conditions than wheat. The minimum temperature for germination occurs between 3-4°C, the optimal temperature being about 20°C, and the maximum temperature between 28-30°C. GROWING PERIOD: Annual grass, can be harvested after 90-120 days for spring varieties, and after 180-240 days for winter varieties.
