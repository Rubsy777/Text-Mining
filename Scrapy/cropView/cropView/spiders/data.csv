2175,Zea mays,"DESCRIPTION: A tall vigorous annual grass, and grain crop varying greatly in size according to race and growth conditions; commercial types are about 2m tall. It has many fasciculate roots. The erect shoot (culm) consists of four basic structures: the internodes, the leaves, the prophyll and the bud or apical meristem, which are collectively called the phytomer. The leaves that emerge from its nodes are alternate, lanceolate, acuminate and parallel-veined with small ligules. Maize is a monoecious plant; it develops inflorescences with unisexual flowers, and these are always born in separate parts of the plant. The female inflorescence - the ear, arises from the axillary bud apices, and male inflorescence, the tassel, develops from the apical growing point at the top of the plant. The kernel or fruit of maize is called a caryopsis. The ovary wall or pericarp is fused with the seed coat or testa and these combined together make the fruit wall. The mature fruit consists of three major parts - fruit wall, diploid embryo and triploid endosperm. The outermost layer of the endosperm, in contact with fruit wall is called the aleurone layer. The mature corn kernel is made up of three main parts, the seed coat or pericarp, the starchy endosperm and the embryo often called the germ, which will develop into a new plant. USES: It is mainly grown for food and fodder. The grain is ground to flour and used in starchy foods and breads. It is used in breakfast foods. Fermented grain is made into alcohol, which has become a prime use in the USA. A ton of dried maize would yield about 370 kg of ethanol. Maize starch is used in cosmetics, adhesives, glucose and syrup. Oil is extracted from the embryo and used as salad oil, and to make linolium, paints, varnishes, etc. KILLING T.: It is easily killed by frost. GROWING PERIOD: Annual. In Kenya quick-maturing lowland varieties flower in 60 days and mature in 120 days, varieties grown between 1200-2100 m in elevation flowers in 105 days and mature in 210 days, while varieties grown at 2100-3200 m may take 195 days to flower and more than 365 days to mature. In the United States on average it mature in 90-140 days. FURTHER INF.: Maize is one of the most productive species of food plants being the second most important cereal grain after wheat, with milled rice occupying third place. It is the top ranking cereal in grain yield per hectare and is second to wheat in total production. Maize is of great economic significance worldwide as human food as animal feed, and as a source of large number of industrial products. Maize has tremendous variability in kernel colour, texture, composition and appearance. It is classified into distinct types based on (a) endosperm and kernel constitution; (b) kernel colour; (c) environment in which it is grown; d) maturity; and (e) its use. White, yellow and orange are prominent grain colours. Prominent maize kernel types are flint, dent, pop, sweet, floury, morocho, and waxy. Quality Protein Maize (QPM with improved protein quality), and High Oil Corn are speciality maize types. It can be found at elevations between sea level and 4000 m and it can be grown at latitudes from 48°N to 40°S. The photosynthesis pathway C4 III for tropical lowland types and C4 IV for highland and temperate types. Hot, dry winds may reduce the amount of pollen available for fertilization and humid conditions and hail can do damage. Since the crop leaves much of the ground uncovered, soil erosion and water losses can be severe. The optimum yield is 7-11 t/ha, world average 3.6 t/ha. High yields of maize make a heavy drain on soil nutrients. It is probably indigenous to Mexico and Central America."

2153,Vigna unguiculata,"DESCRIPTION: It is a herbaceous, prostrate, climbing, or sub-erect to erect legume, growing 15-80 cm high. Erect and bushy to prostrate and creeping growth habits exist depending on cultivar and growing conditions. Cowpeas develop strong root systems that have many spreading laterals in the surface soil. The stems have circular sections and are pock marked. They are sometimes slightly grooved and are glabrous. The texture is fibrous and hard, firm and not inflated when young. Leaves are alternate and trifoliolate and the leaflets are oval, pointed (6-15 cm x 4-11 cm). They are generally entire and sometimes lobed. Genotypes vary in the degree of pubescence, but all cultivated cowpeas are less glabrous than other legumes such as common bean and soybean. Stipules are spurred at the base, stipels are hardly visible. Inflorescence racemose, flowers white, cream, yellow, mauve or purple. Pods usually occur in pairs forming a V, and are non-dehiscent. Pod orientation is mostly pendant and vertical. Pod length ranges from 6.5-25 cm and the width ranges from 3-12 mm. Under warm conditions, pod development is rapid and may take only two weeks from pollination to pod maturation. Each pod holds from 8 to 20 seeds in a crowded orientation. Seed length is between 6-11 mm and the width is from 4-9 mm. The testa colour also varies from white, pinky-white, pink, tan, brown, and black. The hylum is often ringed black or brown, strongly contrasting with the shade of the testa and hence the name ""blackeyed beans"" of the Antilles. The testa is thick and of ellipsoid and more or less rounded form. Number of seeds per kg is from 4600 up to 16000. USES: Cowpea is one of the most important grain legumes in Africa and in parts of the Americas and Asia. In addition to its dry grain, fresh-shelled 'peas', fresh pods, and fresh and dried leaves and flowers are consumed in some regions. The plant is used as cut and carry forage, and for hay and silage. Cowpea forms highly effective associations with a wide range of native nitrogen fixing strains of Rhizobium bacteria and with mycorrhizae that allows the species to tolerate poor soils. Used as a green manure, it can be incorporated into the soil 8-10 weeks after sowing, and can provide the equivalent of 80 kg/ha N to a subsequent crop. KILLING T.: It is susceptible to frost. GROWING PERIOD: Annual. Some cowpea accessions may start flowering 30 days after sowing and are ready for harvest of dry seeds 25 days later; others may take more than 90 days to flower, and 210-240 days to mature. COMMON NAMES: Cowpea, crowder pea, clack-eyed pea, couthern pea, atimbawini, boeme, boontjie, catjang, caupí, frijol de vaca, imbumba, isihlumaya. FURTHER INF.: It is native of West Africa and cultivated throughout the tropics and subtropics between 40ºN and 30ºS at elevations between sea level and 2000 m. Occurs in areas with annual rainfall between 400-2000 mm and summer temperatures between 25-35°C. Found on a wide range of very acid (pH 4) to strongly alkaline also low-fertility soils from sands to heavy, well-drained clays, with a preference for lighter soils. It does not tolerate extended flooding or salinity. Most cowpea accessions exhibit classic short-day responses with respect to time of flowering, although a range of sensitivities occur and the effect is modulated by temperature. It is mainly autogamous and in most environments outcrossing is low (less than 5%), but in the presence of bumble bees or other large insects, out-crossing can be much higher. Flowers open early in the morning, close by noon and may fall off during the same day. The photoperiodism of many African landraces confers adaptation to a specific latitude and rainfall pattern such that flowering and pod development coincide with the end of the rainy season in a particular place ensuring that pods mature in dry weather thus avoiding pod rots and other diseases. The photosynthetic pathway is C3 and the leaves have full maximal rates of photosynthesis at full expansion. Vegetative DM production 3-10 t/ha in 8-12 weeks; grain production 250-4000 kg/ha."

2074,Theobroma cacao,"DESCRIPTION: A small semi-deciduous cauliflorous tree 5-10 m high with a foliage canopy of 4-5 m in diameter when about 10 years old. When fully developed the taproot is 0.8-2 m deep. Lateral roots arise along its entire length but only develop to any great extent in the upper portion, usually from the collar to 15-20 cm down. Up to 10 branched lateral roots may develop in the topsoil covering a 5-6 m radius and with a mass of root hairs. The main trunk is short; branches in whorls of 5, dimorphic; vertical chupons growing from the trunk have leaves arranged in 5/8 phyllotaxy. The lateral branches (fans) have 1/2 phyllotaxy. Stems initially develop orthotropically then in successive elongation phases up to 18 months with a 1-1.5 m trunk. Further growth is interrupted by the degeneration of the terminal bud, below which the first 3-5 branch meristems develop simultaneously, in the form of a whorl growing horizontally. These fan branches form the framework of the tree and are refereed to as a 'jorquette'. The young leaves, which appear either as the trunk develops or during the flushes, are very often pigmented. They appear in accordance with a 3/8 phyllotaxy arrangement. Their colour may vary, depending on the tree type, from pale green, to pink, to deep purple. The young leaves are limp and pendant; as they mature, they become dark green and rigid. The leaves are coriaceous or chartaceous, alternate, and distichous on normal branches. The petiole has 2 joined pulvini, one at the base and the other at the point of insertion of the leaf. Stipules 2, deciduous. Lamina elliptical-oblong or obovate-oblong, simple, 10-45 cm long; generally smooth, sometimes hairy, rounded and obtuse at the base, pointed apex. The inflorescence is dichasial; primary peduncle very short, often thick and lignified. Flower peduncle 1-4 cm long. Sepals 5, triangular, whitish or reddish in colour. Petals 5, joined at the base into a cuplike structure, whitish-yellow with dark purple bands adaxially; ligules spathulate, yellowish. Stamens 5, fertile, alternating with 5 staminodes, the 2 whorls uniting to form a tube. Anthers 2, stamens fused. Ovary superior with a single style terminating in 5 sticky stigmatic surfaces. The fruit is 10-15 cm long and yellow or purplish and is variable in shape, ovoid, oblong; sometimes pointed and constricted at the base or almost spherical, with 10 furrows of which 5 are prominent. Axial placentation, the seeds (embedded in mucilage) flat or round with white or purple cotyledons. The fruit is attached to the branch or trunk by a woody stalk which was originally the stalk of the flower but which thickens as the pod develops. The pericarp or cortex of the pod consists of three distinct layers; the hairy and thick epicarp, which is more or less hard (the epidermis of which may be pigmented); the mesocarp, which is thin and hard and more or less woody; and the hairy endocarp, which is of varying thickness. Pods generally contain an average of thirty to forty seeds, an estimate which is convenient for a rough evaluation of yield in the plantation. However, the number of seeds per pod varies enormously. The cocoa seed or fresh bean is shaped rather like a plump almond, and is surrounded by a white mucilaginous pulp; which is both sweet and rather sour. The average dimensions of the seed are 20-30 mm in length, 12-16 wide and 7-12 thick. Cocoa seeds readily germinate when sown and do not pass through a dormancy period. They lose viability within 5-7 days of extraction from the pod unless specially treated, and germinate within 7-10 days. The plant can easily be propagated vegetatively by leaf-bud cutting, multiple-bud cutting, marcotting, budding, grafting and layering. USES: Food: The cocoa bean, with up to 50% fat, is a valuable source of vegetable fat: cocoa butter. The residual cocoa powder is used in cakes, biscuits, chocolate, drinking chocolate and other confectioneries. Fodder: The cocoa-pod husk has a low alkaloid content, while tannin is practically absent and husks are used as stock feed. The crude fibre content is low; it is completely unlignified and compares favourably with "

1982,Sorghum bicolor var. sweet,"DESCRIPTION: A single-stemmed grass and cereal crop reaching a height of 1-5 m; it is usually taller than grain sorghum. It has a strong root system and a layer of heavy disilicate covers the epidermis of the root. As the root grows to maturity it forms an entire silicon column; which provides it with enough mechanical density during a drought period to prevent the root system from collapsing. It has fibrous, spreading roots and consists of a primary, secondary and supporting roots. The primary root is developed from the seed embryo. It is the only embryo root produced by the seed during germination. Before the production of secondary roots, the primary root is the main organ by which the plant absorbs nutrients and moisture from the soil. Prop roots may grow from culm nodes. There is a bud at each node from which a tiller may grow. The only temporary root in sorghum is the single radicle of the germinating seedling. Mature roots of sorghum are all adventitious. Those permanent roots have numerous branched lateral roots interlacing the soil in all directions. The system may extend to at least 1.5 m away from the plant, and is most abundant in the top 90 cm, although it may extend to twice that depth. One of the important factors affecting water use and drought endurance must be the effectiveness of the root system. While the primary roots of maize and sorghum are equally extensive, sorghum possesses twice as many secondary roots as maize at any one stage of growth. After the plant produces 3-4 leaves, secondary roots grow out from the base of the stalk node near the soil surface. The stalk has about 10-20 clearly protruding nodes and a leaf is produced from every node. Leaves (30-135 cm long and 6-13 cm wide) are opposite-decussate and consist of the sheath, blade and tongue or ligule. The sheath is very long and adheres closely to a major part of the internode. The blade is broad, strap-like, dentate and the surface is smooth and covered with a waxy powder which plays a role in reducing evaporation. In dry conditions, the leaf blade will roll up into a tube, reducing the exposed area and thus cutting down the loss of moisture. Flowers are grouped in an apical panicle formed by several reddish spikelets. The grain is an oblong caryopsis; which consists of the seed coat, testa, endosperm and embryo. The shapes and colours of seeds are very varied and are covered by glumes and there are round, flat-round, oval, ellipse shapes etc. The colours include white, light yellow, pink, brown, red-brown, dark brown etc. In general, the seed of sweet sorghum is smaller than that of grain sorghum; the thousand-seed weight is about 21g varying between 16-28g. (25,000 to 61,740/kg for sweet and grain sorghum; 120,000 to 159,000/kg for grass sorghum). USES: The versatility of sweet sorghum resulted in Prof. Li Dajue (of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and Peter Griffee (FAO) coining the name the ""Four F's Crop"" for sweet sorghum in 1997 at the first International Sweet Sorghum Conference. The ""Four Fs"" represent the four potential outputs from sweet sorghum, namely: Food, Fuel, Fodder, & Fibre. In Asia, R&D has concentrated on maximizing all four outputs to produce the 'multi-purpose' varieties, whilst in Europe, the potential use of sweet sorghum as a sugar producer for fuel ethanol production has driven the current direction of R&D towards liquid bio-fuel production. In southern Africa, the potential for using sweet sorghum for energy and crystalline sugar production is being explored. A disadvantage is that the stems have to be processed within a matter of hours after harvest. However, new technology is emerging for in-field juice extraction and storage to extend the factory processing period. The grain can be ground into flour, some cultivars can be used as popcorn and the grain can be manufactured into beer. Stems are used for thatching, fencing, brushes, and basketry. A dye can be extracted. Grain and straw can be fed to livestock and embryos yield an oil used in cooking and salad oils. The inflorescence has astringent, haemostatic and antidiarrhoeic properties and administration is as infusion, tincture and medicinal wine. GROWING PERIOD: Annual or short-term perennial grass. Most sorghum plants take 90-120 days to mature, the boot stage is reached in 50-60 days, flowering in 60-70 days and full grain maturity in 90-120 days. COMMON NAMES: Sorghum, Sorgho, Sorgo, Great millet, Milo, Jowar, Cholam, Guinea corn, Durra, Mtama, Jowal, Jolar, Cholam, Koaliang. FURTHER INF.: Lowland tropical sorghums are adapted to warm days and night temperatures above 22°C throughout the growing season. The poisonous glucocide 'dhurrin' in sorghum is present from germination, increasing to a maximum and then disappearing as the grain develops, so that in the later stages the plants is safe as fodder. New long day varieties exist. The photosynthesis pathway C4III. The species is probably indigenous to North-East Africa, north of latitude 10°N and east of longitude 25°E. Sorghum is grown between 40°N and S. Sweet sorghum can be found at elevations between sea level and 1500 m, most East African sorghum is grown between the altitudes of 900-1500 m, and cool-tolerant varieties are grown between 1600 and 2500 m. The nutrient removal for 1 ton of grain is about 50 kg N, 9 kg P, and 45 kg K, calculated from the above-ground plant mass. Grain yields of up to 4 t/ha can be obtained, but in the driest areas, the yield usually varies between 0.3-1.2 t/ha, and the global average is about 1.3 t/ha. Like the common grain sorghum, sweet sorghum can produce grain yields of 1500-7500 kg/ha. But the essence of sweet sorghum is not from its seed, but from its stalk; which contains sugar. In general, the stalk yield is 45000-75000 kg/ha. The sugar content in the juice of sweet sorghum varies in different varieties. It's Brix ranges generally from between 15-23%."
48747,Sorghum bicolor,"DESCRIPTION: Summer annual, coarse, erect with much variability in growth characteristics; culms solid or sometimes with spaces in pith, 0.6ˆ5 m tall, depending on variety and growing conditions, 5 to over 30 mm in diameter, either dry at maturity or with sweet insipid juice; leaves broad and coarse, similar in shape to those of corn but shorter and wider; blades glabrous and waxy; sheaths encircle culm and have overlapping margins; panicle erect, sometimes recurved, usually compact in most grain sorghums and more open in forage types; seed covered by glumes that may or may not be removed by threshing; prop roots may grow from culm nodes; bud at each node from which a tiller may grow; seeds white, yellow, red, or brown; panicle with up to 6,000 spikelets. Seeds 25,000 to 61,740/kg. USES: Grown for grain, forage, syrup and sugar, and industrial uses of stems and fibers. Grain sorghum is a staple cereal in hot dry tropics, the threshed grain ground into a wholesome flour. Stalks used as animal feed. Important summer fodder where temperatures are high and rainfall insufficient for corn. Most important for silage or green soiling, or for hay when grown irrigated in very dry areas. FURTHER INF.: Ranging from Cool Temperate Steppe to Wet through Tropical Thorn to Wet Forest Life Zones, sorghum is reported to tolerate annual precipitation of 2.0 to 41.0 (mean of 86 cases = 10.9), annual temperature of 7.8 to 27.8°C (mean of 86 cases = 20.1), and pH of 4.3 to 8.7 (mean of 69 cases = 6.7). Adapted to tropical and subtropical summer rainfall climate with rainfall from 25ˆ125 cm annually; of little importance in more humid areas with higher rainfall. Some cvs are short-day plants. Adapted to wide range of soils varying from light loams to heavy clays; thrives best on light, easily worked soils of high fertility, with moderate to high available water, with erosion not a problem. Moderately well-drained soils are suitable for sorghums. Small amounts of alkali in sand reduces performance considerably. Tolerance to salinity is moderate. Prefers moderately acid soil; pH down to 5.7 does not drastically affect production."

1884,Saccharum officinarum,"DESCRIPTION: The sugar cane plant is a large perennial tropical grass with thick stems that may grow up to 2-3 meters tall, but with extended growing periods it can become much taller. The roots of the cane plant develop from the growth ring on the original planting piece and also from the new shoots that develop. The majority of the roots are thin and superficial with four fifths of the roots commonly found in the top 25-50 cm. Thicker roots will penetrate to depths of four meters or more. The stem of sugarcane is economically the most important plant part. The stems are made up of nodal units, which include the node and the internode. The internal part of the stem is largely parenchyma interspersed with vascular bundles. The parenchyma cells accumulate sugar. Each node subtends a leaf with an axillary bud at the base of the leaf sheath. The individual shoots of sugarcane show strong apical dominance; however, when this is broken the axillary buds develop into new shoots. Contrary to most grasses, the stem is not hollow but filled, as in maize and sorghum. In a magnified cross section it presents the typical aspect of a monocotyledon. Inside the rind tissue and within the vascular bundle is the delicate parenchyma that contains the sucrose-rich plasma. The leaves of sugarcane are distributed alternately on the stem and comprise the leaf sheath and the leaf blade or lamina. The leaf sheath wraps closely round the stem and in some varieties clings to the stem long after the leaf blade and the sheath have senesced. On some varieties the sheath ruptures naturally where it joins the node and the leaves fall naturally. Leaves and sheaths of some varieties are covered with a large number of siliceous hairs. These hairs penetrate the skin of cane cutters and are most unpleasant; hence cane cutters prefer varieties with few hairs or burnt cane. The terminal meristem of the cane shoot turns reproductive about 3 months before the emergence of the flower. The flowers of cane are of no commercial significance per se, and many varietal selection programs are directed towards the elimination of flowering in commercial fields. Flowering is, however, of great importance in breeding programs, many of which use artificial methods to stimulate flowering. USES: It provides raw sugar. Important by-products are bagasse, molasses, filter mud cakes, and cane wax. Bagasse is residue used as fuel, livestock feed, and for the manufacture of fiberboard, paper pulp, plastic, furfural, and cellulose. Molasses are fed to livestock, used for industrial purposes, in confectionary, and it is the source of industrial alcohol as well as rum and gin. Filter mud cakes are used as fertilizer. Cane wax is used in the production of furniture, shoe, and leather polishes, electrical insulating material, and waxed paper. Brazil is a major grower of sugarcane, which is used to produce sugar and provide the ethanol used in making gasoline-ethanol blends (gasohol) for transportation fuel. KILLING T.: Seedlings may not tolerate -7 to -12°C, and the mature plant not -2°C. Long-term exposure to temperatures below 10°C may also be lethal. When temperatures reach 0°C leaves become chlorotic, at about -3°C young plants turn brown and the terminal buds and leaves of mature cane die, at -5.5°C the millable stem dies. When the temperature reaches -11.5°C the whole plant dies in susceptible clones. There are large varietal differences in cold tolerance and susceptibility to frost. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, growing from 7-24 months, usually 14-18 months, with an additional 12 months for the ratoon crop. It is normally grown as a perennial crop in which several ratoons are taken. COMMON NAMES: Sugarcane, Nobel cane, Canne a sucre, Cana de azucar, Zuckerrohr. FURTHER INF.: For ripening relative low temperatures in the range of 10-20°C and dry weather are desirable. Sugarcane is photoperiod sensitive. Flowering is induced by a continuous reduction in day length of as little as 1 minute per day from long days of about 13 hours. Most commercial sugarcane is grown between 35°N and S in the tropics usually at altitudes from sea level to 1600 m. Nobel canes are native to islands in the South Pacific, most probably New Guinea. The photosynthesis pathway C4 III. Cane us is considered to be moderately tolerant to saline soil conditions; electrical conductivity of the soil solution should be less than 2 d S m-1 with a threshold value of 4 d S m-1. In Khuzestan, Iran, cane is grown on soils which have been desalinated from an EC of 30 to 3 dS/m-1. Cane is relatively tolerant of acid soils with large areas of cane in Latin America grown on the acid oxisols and utisols. It prefers moderate to high humidity and high winds cause damage and lower yields. Where sugarcane is grown under irrigation in Africa, a yield of 100-150 tons of cane/ha is obtained from the plant crop and 60-90 tons from the first ratoon crop. Under rain-fed conditions, about half of the above mentioned yield is obtained. Sugarcane is grown on over 20 million ha with an average yield of 64 t/ha to produce a total of 1,25 million t of cane. This is equivalent to about 130 million t of sugar if all the cane were used to produce sugar in moderately efficient factories. Centrifuged sugar production from cane is much less, as large quantities of cane are used to produce alcohol, particularly in Brazil as a liquid fuel."
1885,Saccharum robustum,"BRIEF DESCRIPTION  A grass with unbranched culms, erect or reclinning, hard stems, and with little juice reaching up to 10 m in height.

The pilose surface of the leaves may be green or purple on both sides, or purple on the underside only. Each leaf has seven to eight pairs of lateral veins, which are closer together near the base. The veins on the upper surface are slightly raised, significantly so on the underside. The petiole is flat and villose. Composed of a pair of flowers, the villose corymb inflorescence may grow terminally or from the leaf axil. The ten-veined, campanulate calyx is villous basally outside and yellow glandular dotted on the surface, and pilose near the inside base, arranged in a ring. The calyx is initially about 3 mm long, but expands to 1.1 cm, spreading or drooping and swollen at the base when fruited. The labiate calyx has a broad upper sepal that is three-lobed and slightly longer than the lower sepal, which has two lanceolate lobes. The corolla is campanulate, white to magenta, 3-4 mm long, glabrous, and slightly pilose outside but less so inside. The limb of the corolla is also labiate, and composed of a slightly lobed upper petal and three-lobed lower petal. The sub-globose fruits are reticulate nutlets, grayish brown, about 1.5 mm in diameter. In China, flowers and fruits appear in August and linger until November to December. USES: It is widely cultivated as a source of medicine and spices. Perilla oil, a drying oil, which is contained in the seed, is edible (a cooking oil) and also used as a preservative and energy source. It is used in making paints, varnishes, water proofing etc. The seeds of perilla contain 31 to 51% of this drying oil, which is similar to tung or linseed oil. The plant yields 0.3-1.3% essential oil, which contains 20% citral. It is also used in dental products. One of the aldehyde isomers found in Perilla is 2,000 times as sweet as sugar. HABITAT: It is found wild in pastures and fields, dry woods, along roadsides, about home-sites, and in waste places. ENVIRONMENT: It needs warm weather and can grow in full sun as well as light (not dark) shade. However, the seed needs light to sprout. It thrives in well drained as well as wet soils. It grows well on fertile sites. It is hardy to zone 8 and is frost tender. It prefers light (sandy) and medium (loamy) acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. COMMON NAMES: It is widely known as the beefsteak plant. In North America, it is increasingly commonly called by its Japanese name, shiso in addition to being generally referred to as perilla. FURTHER INF.: The economic return from production of perilla as an oilseed in the United States is unprofitable in comparison with linseed.

Leaf-blade surface glabrous, or pilose. Foliage - tinged with red. Inflorescence an open ovate panicle15-55 cm long. Spikelets solitary. Fertile spikelets pedicelled. Spikelets comprising 1 basal sterile florets; 1 fertile floret; without rhachilla extension. Spikelets ovate; dorsally compressed; 3-5 mm long; falling entire. Glumes reaching apex of florets; thinner than fertile lemma. Lower glume ovate; clasping; 0.66-0.75 times length of spikelet; membranous; without keels; 5 -veined. Lower glume apex acuminate. Upper glume ovate; 1 times length of spikelet; membranous; without keels; 7-veined. Upper glume apex acuminate. Basal sterile florets male; with palea.

Fertile lemma ovate; dorsally compressed; 2.5-3.5 mm long; indurate; pallid; shiny; without keel. Lemma margins involute. Lemma apex acute. Palea involute; indurate. Anthers 3. Fruit is a caryopsis with an adherent pericarp. USES: It is a cultivated range and fodder grass and is grazed by certain animals, used as ground cover to control erosion and farmed as forage for livestock. As a drought resistant ornamental grass, it is easily grown in average to wet soils and in full sun to part shade. Establishment is recommended in the spring, at the same time as maize is planted. It can also be used for silage and as an energy substitute and is often considered a good candidate for bio-fuel, especially ethanol fuel production, due to its hardiness against poor soil and climate conditions, rapid growth and low fertilization and herbicide requirements. It has the potential to produce the biomass required for production of up to 380 liters of ethanol per metric ton. This gives it the potential to produce over 400 liters of ethanol per hectare, compared to 270 for sugarcane and 160 for corn. However, there is debate on the viability of switchgrass, and other bio-fuels, as an efficient energy source. University of California, Berkeley professor Tad Patzek argues that switchgrass has a negative ethanol fuel energy balance, requiring 45 percent more fossil energy than the fuel produced. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial; warm season; sod forming; slow spreader. FURTHER INF.: Switchgrass uses C4 carbon fixation, giving it an advantage in conditions of drought and high temperature. As an open pollinated species, switchgrass expresses tremendous genetic diversity, with wide variations in its basic chromosome number (2n = 18), typically ranging from tetraploid to octoploid. Morphologically switchgrass in its southern range can grow to more than 3 m in height, but what is most distinctive is the deep, vigorous root system, which may extend to depths of more than 3.5 m. It reproduces both by seeds and vegetatively and, with its perennial life form, a stand can last indefinitely once established. Standing biomass in root systems may exceed that found aboveground, giving perennial grasses such as switchgrass, an advantage in water and nutrient aquisition even under stressful growing conditions.

75061,Orbignya phalerata,"DESCRIPTION: It is an erect, sometimes solitary palm reaching 20-30 m in height. Full grown palms have an almost bare stem, slightly conical with a diameter of 20-50 cm. Surface grey to brown, smooth and obscurely ringed with leaf scars, adventitious roots sometimes visible at the base of the stem. The stem carries a dense crown, of arching pinnate leaves, with a diameter of about 8 m. It consists of 15-20 leaves, each reaching 5-8 m in length. The top leaves are typically pointing upward. The inflorescence is cream-white turning yellow and finally brownish at anthesis. Flowers unisexual. Staminate flowers yellowish, slightly fragrant, asymmetrical with 3 sepals and 2-3 petals. Pistillate flowers cream-yellow with 3-6 sepals and 3-5 petals. It produces fruit in large bunches containing, on average, 200 individual fruits and attaining a length of one meter or more. However, bunches with up to 600 fruits do occur. Bunches may have very long stalks. The individual bunch weights range from 40-90 kg and the tree produces 1-4 bunches each year. Production starts when it is around 8 years old. The individual fruits are 8-15 cm long and 5-9 cm broad and weigh 150-200 g. Palms growing wild produce only 20 kg/ha compared to 1500 kg/ha in experimental plantations. This is largely due to the greater tree density. Each fruit contains 3-8 kernels. USES: The kernel yields 60-70% of oil, which is somewhat similar to coconut oil. It is colourless and does not readily become rancid. Refined oil can be used for margarine production and general food purposes. The crude oil is suitable for soap production and detergents. It is also used for burning in lamps. In addition to its importance for the extraction of edible oil the Babassu palm can be used to make many products during its life cycle. The leaves are used for thatch, basketwork, construction and fodder, the trunks for bridges and building and the fruit for animal feed and charcoal. The palm is of considerable economic importance in rural Brazil and it is estimated that some 450 000 families collect and process Babassu. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Babassu, babaçu, aguassu, coco de macaco. FURTHER INF.: It requires a tropical humid climate and high temperatures with plenty of sunshine. It is mainly found on moderately drained alluvial sandy soils that are not exposed to water logging or flooding. It requires fertile soil. It may become a weed. The apical meristem remains below ground for several years after the leaves have emerged. This makes it an aggressive competitor in some circumstances and control is therefore difficult."

1420,Manihot esculenta,"DESCRIPTION: An erect shrub with an upright woody stems reaching a height of 4 m or more. The mature tuber may measure 1 m in length and weigh up to 2 kg. The cassava plant may be divided into two main parts: the shoot system, which consists of stem, leaves and reproductive structures or flowers; and the root system, which consists of feeder roots and tubers. The fleshy elongated tuberous roots or rhizomes, are very woody, only slightly thickened in wild varieties; under cultivation up to 2.5 m long and 10-15 cm in diameter, weighing up to 40 kg, averaging 4-7 kg; leaves usually deeply 3-7-parted with spatulate to linear-lanceolate acuminate lobes 7.5-15 cm long, glabrous, glaucous beneath and minutely puberulent along veins, long petioled; flowers in panicles, less than 1.2 cm long; capsules globose, about 1.2 cm across, with 6 winged angles; seeds 3 per capsule. USES: Cassava provides a major source of calories for poor families, because of its high starch content. With minimum maintenance, the farmers can dig up the starchy root of the cassava and eat it 6 months to 3 years after planting. Thus, people can cultivate cassava during times of conflict or natural disaster when no other food is available. The tubers have a high content of carbohydrates, phosphorous, iron, and calcium and are a valuable source of food. Cassava starch is used in cooking and cassava flour is used in puddings, biscuits and other confectionary. In Africa, people also eat the leaves of the cassava as a green vegetable, which provide a cheap and rich source of protein and vitamins A and B. (Young leaves are cooked like spinach). Various industries use it as a binding agent, because it is an inexpensive source of starch. Cassava starch is used in the production of paper and textiles and as monosodium glutamate (MSG), an important flavoring agent in Asian cooking. In Africa, cassava is beginning to be used in partial substitution for wheat flour, thus providing income to resource-poor farmers and saving foreign exchange for national Governments. The plant is also used in the production of adhesives, cosmetics, textiles, and paper. It is fed to livestock. Alcoholic beverages and ethanol for fuel are made from the tubers. The advantage of cassava for ethanol production is that the tubers may be stored in the ground for many months before processing; thus extending the factory window. KILLING T.: May not tolerate 7°C for prolonged periods and it is easily killed by frost. GROWING PERIOD: Short-lived perennial. Mature leaves may be harvested 50-70 days from insertion of the cuttings. The 'sweet' cassavas mature in 180-270 days, the 'bitter' in 12-18 months. Growing period 6-24 months, depending on cultivar and conditions.

FUTHER INF.: Cassava is seldom grown above 1800 m in elevation in the tropics, maximum elevation for successfull cultivation is about 1000 m. Latitudinal range is 25°N to 30°S. Maximum tolerated slope is about 5°. The photosynthesis pathway is C3 II. Prefers moderate humidity. Tuber production is delayed and reduced in daylengths greater than 10-12 hours. Cassava is native to the countries between the Amazon region and southern Mexico. World production for 2004 was estimated at 204819995 metric tons. Production in Asia during the same period was 60492789 metric tons and in Africa 108974574. Area harvested in 2004: World 18051574 hectares Brazil 1754875 Congo 1842559 Indonesia 1255805 Nigeria 3531000 and Mozambique 1068500 hectares. Yields from small holders average 5-15 t/ha, but yields of up to 30 t/ha can be obtained. Scientists at two CGIAR research centers IITA and CIAT have developed elite varieties of cassava with improved qualities. IITA has discovered spontaneous polyploids in cassava, which are characterized by enormous vigor and variation in form and structure. Selections from triploids ""super cassava"" have doubled the yields of existing improved varieties with normal chromosome numbers. IITA has also introduced to Africa a wider genetic base for cassava improvement, focusing on materials with resistance to mites, mealybugs, cassava bacterial blight, tolerance to drought, low cyanogen potential, and good cooking quality. Together, IITA and CIAT launched a biological control campaign of the mealybug and are cooperating with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in the formulation of a global development strategy for cassava."

It can for non-commercial production be grown at elevations up to 1200 m and up to 600 m for commercial production. It does best with strongly marked seasons in the tropical summer rainfall regions with dry weather and moderate humidity for flowering and fruiting. High humidity, mist and heavy dew promote fungal attack, while low humidity and drying wind can cause wilting and strong winds may destroy the crop. In areas with two wet seasons flowering and fruit production may occur twice each year, but normally only one crop per year is produced. Very fertile soils with adequate supplies of water thoughout the year may result in luxuriant vegetative growth and poor cropping. The trees are drought-tolerant and do not seem to suffer from occasional flooding. According to Purseglove even shallow and impervious soils produce mangoes, but for optimal conditions the watertable should be below 2-2.5 m. Photosynthesis pathway C 3 II. In the 10th year, a tree bears 400-600 fruits. A plantation of full-grown trees may produce 10-30 t/ha of fruit year.

Inflorescence a cyme formed terminally on branches and complex, possessing main and co-florescences with paracladia. The plant is monoecious and flowers are unisexual; occasionally hermaphroditic flowers occur; 10 stamens arranged in 2 distinct whorls of 5 each in a single column in the androecium and in close proximity to each other. In the gynaecium, the 3 slender styles are connate to about 2/3 of their length, dilating to a massive bifurcate stigma. Female flowers with sepals up to 18 mm long, persistent; ovary 3-locular, ellipsoid, 1.5-2 mm in diameter, style bifid. Fruit an ellipsoid capsule 2.5-3 cm long, 2-3 cm in diameter, yellow, turning black. Seeds black, 2 per cell, ellipsoid, triangular-convex, 1.5-2 x 1-1.1 cm. Pollination is by insects. The rare hermaphroditic flowers can be self-pollinating. After pollination the trilocular ellipsoid fruit is formed. The exocarp remains fleshy until the seeds are mature. In Thailand, there are 2 flowering peaks, in November and May. In permanently humid equatorial regions, flowering occurs throughout the year. Fruit development needs 90 days from flowering until seeds mature. Shrubs begin to produce at 4-5 months and reach full productivity at about 3 years. The female flowers are 4-5 times more numerous than the male ones. USES: Young leaves may be safely eaten when steamed or stewed. Cooked nuts are eaten in certain regions of Mexico. The seeds yield up to 31-37% of a valuable oil. The seed oil is renewable source of non-conventional bio-diesel. Fruit hulls and seed shells can be used as a fuel.

1232,Hordeum vulgare,"DESCRIPTION: A freely tillering cultivated grass and cereal crop reaching a height of 50-100 cm. As with wheat and oats, barley also presents two types of root systems. In the first, the seedling roots develop from germination to the tillering stage; in the second, which starts at tillering, the secondary crown roots, or adventitious roots, appear. These will serve to anchor the plant, and to provide it with water and nutrients. The depth they reach will depend on the hydric condition of the soil, its texture and structure, external and internal temperatures, and on the genetic make up of the variety. The stems of the barley plant are erect and made up of 5 to 7 hollow, cylindrical internodes or joints, separated by the nodes, which bear the leaves. As in all Gramineae, the leaves are placed opposite their neighbours along the stem. The leaves are linear lanceolate and formed of sheath, blade, auricles and ligule. The sheaths surround the stem completely. The ligule, and especially the auricles, distinguish barley from other cereal grains: they are glabrous, envelop the stem and can be pigment with anthocyanins. Flowers-spikes: the last internode of the stem extends as a rachis, which bears the spicules alternating on its nodes. Spikes of distich barleys do not have a terminal spicule as do those of wheat. Spikes can be awned, mutic (blunt) or hooded, and also can be smooth or toothed. The spikes can have two or six rows of grain, depending on the fertility of the lateral spikes. The rachis has 10 to 30 nodes, so the ears of six-row barleys can have from 25 up to 60 grains, and two-row barleys 25 to 30. The fruit is an oval, ridged caryopsis with rounded ends. The spike may be long or short, according to the plant type, but it always has several glumes with filiform awns that may diverge. Seeds are generally covered, with the palea and the lemma adhered to them, or can be open. Grains can be white in colour, blue, black, etc. Barley is predominantly autogamous. USES: In the traditional areas, most barley is use for animal feed (half of the world's barley production). In the non-traditional areas, barley's principal use is as food, followed by animal feed and use as raw material for the malting industry. Pearl barley (used in soups, or fed to live stock) is the decorticated caryopsis, while barley that is allowed to germinate and is then dehydrated is called malt. A very nourishing drink made from the latter can be used as a substitute for coffee. Barley is also used commercially in the making of beer and whiskey. The cereal is prepared for eating by boiling or parching the whole grain. It can then be ground for gruel or made into flour for baking. Barley can also be grown as a hay crop. The caryopsis is used to prepare decoctions and fluid extract. It has nutritive, emollient and anticatarrhal properties. KILLING T.: The main climatic mishap is frost damage to the seedlings, when the death of many plants can drastically thin out the crop. At the seedling stage, barley is more susceptible to freezing conditions than wheat. The minimum temperature for germination occurs between 3-4°C, the optimal temperature being about 20°C, and the maximum temperature between 28-30°C. GROWING PERIOD: Annual grass, can be harvested after 90-120 days for spring varieties, and after 180-240 days for winter varieties. COMMON NAMES: barley, food barley, feed barley, malting barley, orge, cebada, gerste, gebs, garbu, segem, schair, sheko, bongo. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonym: "

First-formed pods usually remain on stalk until last-formed pods mature. One plant may produce 530-1,840 fruits. USES: Crambe appears to be a better potential domestic crop than rapeseed. It is the cheapest source of erucic acid, which performs better than any known material as a mold lubricant in continuous steel casting. Test plantings in Russia, under a wide variety of ecological conditions, gave oil contents of 25-33% for seed with hulls (dehulled seeds reached 54%). There are reported yields of 169-840 kg/ha in Indiana, 2,000 in Missouri, suggesting oil yields of about 60-600 kg/ha. Hull-free seeds contain about 26% protein. Crambe meal is used as plywood and rubber adhesive, as a source of protein isolates, and as an additive to waxes. Crambe meal, after unpalatable material is removed or made inactive, may be used as supplement for ruminants not to exceed one-third to one-half of the supplement; it is not recommended for pigs and poultry. The meal is also used as an insecticide. It is used in crop rotations for alleviating weed, pest and disease build-up. GROWING PERIOD: Annual, From planting to harvest requires about 100 days, but this may vary considerably. It has been adapted as a spring crop. KILLING TEMP: Seedlings may survive -4 to -6°C for short periods, but at all later stages of growth -1°C may kill the plant. COMMON NAMES: Crambe, Colewort. FURTHER INF.: Crambe is probably a native of western Asia. It can be grown at elevations between sea level and 2000 m or even up to 2500 m in Kenya. Hail can cause severe damage to crambe, though it generally will recover. Seed yields vary widely from 1,125-1,624 kg/ha in Russia and 450-2,522 kg/ha in the United States, with yields highest in weed-free fields. In irrigated fields with additional nitrogen, yields up to 5 MT/ha have been attained. Cost of production is about the same as for barley. The major problems are weed control and seed-shattering."

Flowers in terminal racemes to compound panicles with numerous, sub-sessile whitish flowers. Sepals 4 - lanceolate, concave, firm, glabrous outside, pubescent inside. Petals absent. Stamens free, (8-10), the anthers elliptic, versatile. Ovary hirsute; briefly stipitate; fruit ovoid, compressed, ca 2 x 3 cm, coriaceous, with one large seed partially covered with a thick aril. USES: The oleoresin called Œcopaiba‚ can be obtained by drilling a 5cm deep hole into the trunk, which is then closed with a bung. Every 6 months or so, the bung is removed and 15 to 20 litres of a hydrocarbon collected. The wood of the tree is honeycombed with a network of connected cavities in which the oleoresin forms. To tap the tree, a drainage reservoir is hollowed out near its base by cutting inward and downward into the centre of the trunk. The cavities containing the oleoresin gradually drain into these hollowed-out wells. This process is repeated several times during the season. When first obtained, copaiba is thin and clear but on aging becomes thicker and acquires a yellowish tinge. This liquid can be used as a diesel substitute and is used in lacquers, massage preparations, medicines, and paints. Wood and resin can be used for fuel. The wood is used in carpentry. FURTHER INF.: It occurs from subtropical dry to wet through tropical dry to wet forest life zones. Copaiba probably tolerates annual precipitation of 1000 to 4000 mm, annual temperature of 20 to 27°C (with no frost), and pH of 4.5 to 7.5.

749,Coffea arabica,"DESCRIPTION: A globose evergreen, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree attaining heights of up to 5-10 m (when not pruned). The root system of the mature coffee tree consists of: a taproot, which is often extensively branched, robust, and generally short (0.3 to 0.5 m), but may grow as long as 1.0 m in deep soils. A number of secondary roots develop from the taproot and grow vertically downwards. The lighter and more penetrable the soil, the deeper they will develop. Their role, together with that of the taproot, is to assist in anchorage and supplying water to the plant. Lateral roots, which are generally numerous, develop, often almost horizontally, and are further extended by a network of rootlets. They explore the superficial and richest layers of the soil. Their role is essentially to provide mineral nutrition to the plant. Its branches are opposite, long, flexible, and rather thin; its habit is semi-erect when young and spreading or pendulous when adult. The petiolate leaves are dark glossy green, simple, opposite, acuminate; having a short petiole with undulating margins and a slightly crinkled surface, they are 10-15 cm long and 4-6 cm wide, sometimes bearing interpetiolar stipules. They have a prominent leaf midrib and lateral veins. Flowers produced in dense clusters along reproductive branches in the axils of the leaves. White, sweet scented, star-shaped and carried on stout but short peduncles. Bracteoles united, forming a cup-shaped epicalyx at the base of the flower. There are 5 calyx segments halfway the length, spreading out very widely at the anthesis and 5 stamens inserted in the corolla tube. Anthers carried on long, slender, upright filaments. It is about 90% autogamous (self-fertile) thus a great number of its flowers are fertilised before anthesis. Ovary inferior, 2 united unilocular carpels, each containing a single ovule attached to the base of the carpel wall. The ovary bears a slender style, which terminates in short, pointed bifid stigmas. The ovary is in the form of a drupe, and is commonly called a cherry. The cherry is ovoid or sub-globulous, red when ripe, 10-15 mm wide and 16-18 mm long, and consists of a coloured exocarp (skin), a fleshy, yellowish-white mesocarp (pulp) and two beans or seeds (8.5-12.5 mm long, ellipsoidal in shape and pressed together by flattened surface that is deeply grooved; outer surface convex) joined together along their flat sides. When one of the two ovaries aborts, the other develops into an ovoid bean, which is commercially known as a 'peaberry'. Each bean is protected by two coats. The first, the endocarp, is thin with a fibrous texture (parchment) and the second, the perisperm, is a very fine membrane (skin or silverskin) that more or less adheres to the bean. The size and shape of the beans differ depending on variety, environmental conditions, and cropping practices. On average, they are 10 mm long, 6-7 mm wide and 3-4 mm thick. They weigh 0.15-0.20 g. Dried seeds, after removal of the silvery skin, provide the coffee beans of commerce. The optimum temperature for the germination of coffee seeds is about 30°-32°C, below 10°C germination is very slow. USES: Food: Dried seeds (?beans?) are roasted, ground, and brewed to make 1 of the 2 most popular beverages in the world. In its native Ethiopia, it has been used as a masticatory since ancient times. Cooked in butter, it can be used to make rich flat cakes. Coffee is widely used as flavouring in ice cream, pastries, candies, and liqueurs. In Arabia, a fermented drink from the pulp is consumed. Fodder: Pulp and parchment are occasionally fed to cattle in India. Apiculture: Honeybees collect nectar and pollen from the flowers. The honey is light with a characteristic flavour. Mixed coffee-orange honey is very highly valued. Timber: Wood is hard, dense, durable, takes a polish well, and is suitable for tables, chairs and turnery. The bark can be made into pulp, parchment, manure and mulch. Soil improver: The pulp and parchment are used as manure and mulches. Annual litter fall from both shade and crop trees, including pruning residues, maintain soil organic matter levels and hence the cation exchange capacity; this reduces the risk of leaching losses and permits a more efficient use of any inorganic fertilizers applied.

744,Cocos nucifera,"DESCRIPTION: The coconut is an evergreen palm, in strict botanical terms it is not a tree. It has no bark, branches, cambium or secondary growth. It is a woody, perennial monocotyledon and its trunk is a stem, which grows to about 25 m and exceptionally 30m; dwarf selections also exist. Being a monocotyledon the coconut has no taproot and adventitious roots develop continually from the bole. Roots may spread from the bole in any direction and at any angle below the horizontal for up to 10 m or more, depending on soil and water supply. The m ain roots are about 10mm in diameter with secondary and tertiary branches. When young they are coloured white to cream and have a very sharp tipped growing point below a loose root cap about 12mm long. There are no root hairs. The rate of elongation is not uniform and the root takes on a banded appearance as it matures and its colour darkens through shades of orange. When growth eventually ceases the root is brown with a tip that is rounded and blunt. The smallest branches are about 1-2mm in diameter and are short lived and frequently replaced. Where they occur at, or in wet conditions sometimes above, ground level the secondary and tertiary roots remain as very small, peg-like pneumatophores, or ""breathing roots"".

Turnip is native of central and southern Europe. Cultivated in Europe for over 4000 years, probably native to central and southern Europe, now spread throughout world, including most parts of the tropics. In the tropics, it is suitable for elevations above 1000 m and only very few cultivars can be grow at low elevations. Turnip is basically a cool climate crop, resistant to frost and mild freezes. Temperatures below 10°C cause bolting. Turnips do well in deep, friable, highly fertile soil with pH of 5.5-6.8; sandy loams are used for early markets roots and greens. Their short growing season makes them very adaptable as a catch crop. Ranging from Boreal Moist to Rain through Tropical Thorn to Moist Forest Life Zones, it is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation of 3500 to 4100 mm, an annual temperature of 3.6 to 27.4°C and a pH of 4.2 to 7.8.

2830,Aegiceras corniculatum,SOURCES
2829,Adonis vernalis,"DESCRIPTION: It is a herbaceous plant reaching up to 30 cm in height. The stem is branching, and the leaves many-cleft and sessile. The flowers are large, yellow, and attractive. USE: A toxic principle is present in very small quantities in the plant. It is poorly absorbed so poisoning is unlikely. The plant contains cardiac glycosides similar to those found in the foxglove (Digitalis purpurea). These substances improve the heart's efficiency, increasing its output at the same time as slowing its rate. It also has a sedative action and so is generally prescribed for patients whose hearts are beating too fast or irregularly. The herb is not often prescribed, however, due to irregular absorption.
